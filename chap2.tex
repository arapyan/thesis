\chapter{Introduction}

The Standard Model (SM) theory of elementary particles provides a remarkably successful description of many experimental results up to currently accessible energies. Leptons and colored quarks are the building blocks of matter and the SM provides a fundamental theory of strong~\cite{Politzer:1973fx,Gross:1973id} and electroweak interactions~\cite{Glashow:1961tr,Weinberg:1967tq,Salam:1968rm}. The strong interactions are mediated by massless gluons, and the force carriers of the electroweak interactions are the massless photon and the massive $W$ and $Z$ bosons. The SM is a renormalizable gauge theory based on the symmetry group $SU(3) \times SU(2) \times U(1)$. However the massive $W$ and $Z$ gauge bosons and the massless photon clearly brake the electroweak symmetry. It was shown that the masses can be generated through spontaneous symmetry breaking by adding a complex scalar field to the model~\cite{Englert:1964et,Higgs:1964ia,Higgs:1964pj,Guralnik:1964eu,Higgs:1966ev,Kibble:1967sv}. A physical neutral heavy scalar boson, the SM Higgs boson ($H$), remains after the spontaneous symmetry breaking for a complex scalar Higgs doublet. The scalar field can also account for the fundamental fermion masses. Postulated Yukawa couplings of the Higgs field to the fundamental fermions introduces the fermion mass terms after the same spontaneous symmetry breaking mechanism that gives masses to the $W$ and $Z$ gauge bosons. 

The mass of the SM Higgs boson ($m_{H}$) is a free parameter in the theory. However the $m_{H}$ should be smaller than about $1~\TeV$ to retain perturbative unitarity of the longitudinal $W/Z$ boson scattering amplitude at higher centre-of-mass energies~\cite{Cornwall:1973tb,Cornwall:1974km,LlewellynSmith:1973yud,Lee:1977eg}.  Previous direct and model-independent searches at the LEP $e^{+}e^{-}$ collider excluded the existence of a Higgs boson with a mass less than $114.4~\GeV$ at $95\%$ Confidence Level (C.L.) at $e^+e^-$ centre-of-mass energies between $90$ and $209~\GeV$~\cite{Barate:2003sz}. Direct searches were performed at the Tevatron collider in proton-antiproton collisions at centre-of-mass energy of $1.96~\TeV$ excluding the existence of a SM Higgs boson in the mass regions of $90-109~\GeV$ and $149-182~\GeV$, and reporting a broad excess in the mass regions of $115-140~\GeV$ with a significance of $2.8$ standard deviations~\cite{Aaltonen:2013ioz}. The significance is not corrected for the so called look-elsewhere effect~\cite{loook}. Moreover, indirect constraints from a global fit of the precision electroweak data at LEP, SLC, and the Tevatron colliders suggest $m_{H}=89^{+22}_{-18}~\GeV$, or $m_{H}<127~\GeV$ at $90\%$ (C.L.)~\cite{Agashe:2014kda}. It has to be noted that the global fit includes the Tevatron measurement of the $W$ mass~\cite{Aaltonen:2013iut} that is $1.5$ standard deviation higher than the SM best fit value.

The search for the SM Higgs boson has been one of the highlights of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC)~\cite{1748-0221-3-08-S08001}. In July 2012, the ATLAS and CMS collaborations announced the observation of a narrow resonance with a mass of about $125~\GeV$ with properties consistent with the SM Higgs boson~\cite{Aad:2012tfa,Chatrchyan:2012xdj}. Significant excesses were observed in $\gamma\gamma$ and $ZZ$ decay modes with rates consistent with the SM predictions. There were also strong hints in the data that the new particle decays to $W^+W^-$. The observed decay channels indicate that the new particle is a boson. Figure~\ref{fig:cms_higgs} shows the distributions of the diphoton invariant mass (weighted by the signal-to-background ratio) and four-lepton invariant mass for the $ZZ \rightarrow 4\ell$ decays from the CMS results. The ATLAS and CMS continued to take data after the discovery announcement. Subsequent measurements of the Higgs boson production and decay rates combining the ATLAS and CMS results with proton-proton collisions at centre-of-mass energies of $7$ and $8~\TeV$ show a consistent picture with the SM Higgs predictions~\cite{Khachatryan:2016vau}. The combined measurement measured mass of the discovered boson is $m_{H}=125.09 \pm 0.21 \mathrm{(stat.)} \pm 0.11 \mathrm{(syst.)}~\GeV$~\cite{Aad:2015zhl}. The spin and CP properties of the new boson are also consistent with those expected of the SM Higgs boson~\cite{Chatrchyan:2012jja,Aad:2013xqa,Khachatryan:2014kca}.

The measurement of the Higgs boson decays to $b\bar{b}$ and $\tau^{+}\tau^{-}$ is essential for identifying if the new boson is the SM Higgs boson. Both decay modes provide a direct probe of the Higgs Yukawa coupling to fermions. The $\tau^{+}\tau^{-}$ decay mode is currently the most promising channels to study the SM Higgs boson coupling to leptons.

\section{Overview of the Standard Model}

\subsection{Quantum Chromodynamics}

The gauge group of the strong interactions of the colored quarks and gluons is $SU(3)$. The gauge invariant and reonormalizable Langrangian of the quantum chromodynamics (QCD) is given by:

 \begin{equation} \label{eq:lumi}
L = \sum_{q} \bar{\psi}_{q,a} (i \gamma^{\mu}\delta_{\mu}\delta_{ab}-g_{s}\gamma^{\mu}t^{C}_{ab}A^{C}_{\mu}-m_{q}\delta_{ab})\psi_{q,b}-\frac{1}{4}F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}-\theta\frac{g_{s}^2}{72\pi^2}\epsilon_{\mu\nu\sigma\rho}F^{\mu\nu}F^{\rho\sigma},
\end{equation}
where repeated indices are summed over.

\section{The Large Hadron Collider}
The LHC~\cite{1748-0221-3-08-S08001} is a circular proton-proton collider located at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN). The tunnel has a circumference of $26.7$ km and previously hosted the Large Electron-Positron (LEP)~\cite{lep1,lep2} collider. Located at the border of France and Switzerland, the tunnel lies between $45$ m and $170$ m below the surface. The LHC is designed to collide beams of protons at centre-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s}$ of up to $14~\TeV$. While the LHC is primarily a proton-proton collider, lead (Pb) ion beams of energy of $2.3~\TeV$ per nucleon are used to produce lead-lead  and proton-lead collisions.  
 
Figure~\ref{fig:cern} shows a schematic representation of the accelerator complex at CERN. Ionized hydrogen atoms are accelerated to an energy of $50~\MeV$ in the Linac $2$ linear accelerator. Thereafter they are injected into the Proton Synchrotron Booster (PSB) and Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) raising the energy to $25~\GeV$ and $450~\GeV$ respectively. From the SPS the protons are injected into two separate rings in discrete bunches. At the design bunch spacing of $25$ ns there are $2808$ proton bunches per beam.

\end{figure}

Using the synchrotron method the design beam energy is achieved with $1232$ dipole magnets (15 meters in length) with a peak dipole field of $8.33$ Tesla. Quadrupole magnets (492) of $5-7$ meters in length are used to focus the beams. Two beam pipes with counter rotating beams are required as the LHC is a particle-particle accelerator.  Space limitations in the tunnels led to the adoption of the twin-bore~\cite{Blewett:1971zzb} magnet design where the beam pipes are magnetically coupled and the magnets share the same mechanical structure and cryostat. The target magnetic field is achieved using niobium-titanium superconducting electromagnets with operating temperatures of $1.9$ K. Superfluid helium is used to cool the magnets to the operating temperature.

The total hadronic cross section is based on a parameterization from Particle Data Group~\cite{Agashe:2014kda}. The remaining cross sections are calculated at NLO or NNLO using MSTW2008 parton distributions~\cite{MSTW}. The discontinuities illustrate the differences in cross sections between the proton-proton and proton-antiproton collisions.}
\label{fig:xsec}
\end{figure}

The goal of the LHC is to elucidate the mechanism of the EWSB and to look for hints of the BSM physics. The rate of events generated in the LHC collisions is given by 
\begin{equation} \label{eq:lumi}
N = \sigma L,
\end{equation}
where $\sigma$ is the cross section of the event under study and $L$ is the luminosity. Figure~\ref{fig:xsec} shows the production cross sections of various SM processes as a function of $\sqrt{s}$ in proton-proton and proton-antiproton collisions. The rear processes of interest at the LHC are orders of magnitude smaller than the total hadronic cross section. Therefore, in addition to high beam energies, high beam intensities are required. The design peak luminosity at the LHC is $10^{34}$ cm$^2$s$^{-1}$ for the proton-proton collisions. The high beam intensity requirement excludes the feasibility of using proton-antiproton collisions at the LHC.

\caption{The total integrated luminosity delivered to CMS during stable beams in proton-proton collisions~\cite{lumi_plot}. It is shown for $2010$ (green), $2011$ (red), $2012$ (blue), $2015$ (purple), and $2016$ (orange) data taking periods. The total integrated luminosity is shown for the data collected up to the end of August for the 2016 data taking period.} 
\label{fig:int}
\end{figure}

The machine luminosity depends only on the beam parameters. For a Gaussian beam distribution the dependance is given by
\begin{equation} \label{eq:lumi_beam}
L = \frac{N_{b}^2n_bf_{rev}\gamma_{r}}{4\pi\epsilon_n\beta^{*}}F,
\end{equation}
where $N_b$ is the number of particle per bunch ($\mathcal{O}(10^{11})$), $n_b$ is the number of bunches per beam, $f_{rev}$ is the revolution frequency, $\gamma_r$ is the relativistic gamma factor, $\epsilon_n$ is the normalized transverse beam emittance, $\beta^{*}$ is the beta function at the collision point, and $F$ is the geometric luminosity reduction factor due to the crossing angle at the interaction point.  The LHC has four interaction points that host ALICE~\cite{Aamodt:2008zz}, ATLAS~\cite{Aad:2008zzm}, CMS~\cite{Chatrchyan:2008aa}, and LHCb~\cite{Alves:2008zz} detectors. The ATLAS and CMS are general purpose, high luminosity experiments. The LHCb is a forward detector specializing in heavy flavor physics. The ALICE experiment is designed to study heavy-ion collisions.   


Figure~\ref{fig:int} shows the total integrated luminosity delivered to CMS during stable beams from October, $2010$ to August, $2016$ data taking periods. The LHC delivered proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ of $7~\TeV$ during $2010$ and $2011$. The total integrated luminosity delivered in $2011$ was $6.1~\ifb$ with a peak instantaneous luminosity of $4.0 \times 10^{33}$ cm$^2$ s$^{-1}$. The luminosity recorded and certified, where all the detector sub-components are confirmed to operate normally, for physics results was $5.1~\ifb$. $\sqrt{s}$ was increased to $8~\TeV$ in $2012$ with $23.3~\ifb$ total integrated luminosity delivered to CMS with a peak instantaneous luminosity of $7.7 \times 10^{33}$ cm$^2$ s$^{-1}$. The total certified data amounted to $19.7~\ifb$. A bunch spacing of $50$ ns was used in the $2011$ and $2012$ data taking periods.

\label{fig:pu}
\end{figure} 

The LHC entered the Long Shutdown $1$ (LS1) in $2013$ for maintenance and upgrades during which the CMS detector was upgraded as well. The data taking resumed in $2015$ with $4.2~\ifb$ total integrated luminosity delivered to CMS with a peak instantaneous luminosity of $5.1 \times 10^{33}$ cm$^2$ s$^{-1}$. The LHC started to operate with the nominal bunch spacing of $25$ ns during this period. The total certified data for the nominal CMS operation and bunch spacing of $25$ ns amounted to $2.3~\ifb$. The data taking continued in $2016$ with an excellent performance by the LHC with significantly lower transverse beam sizes. This was achieved using a new bunch production scheme which resulted in a peak luminosity of  $1.2 \times 10^{34}$ cm$^2$ s$^{-1}$. Total integrated luminosity of $26.1~\ifb$ was delivered by the end of August of $2016$.   

Figure~\ref{fig:pu} shows the mean number of additional inelastic proton-proton interactions per bunch crossing (pileup). The additional pileup interactions in events present challenges in reconstruction and identification of the particles originating from the hard scattering of interest. The average number of pileup interactions in $2011$ was $9$ as the instantaneous luminosity continuously increased during the year. The average number of pileup interactions further increased to $20$ in $2012$ and reached to $24$ during $2016$.  While higher instantaneous luminosities are desired to enhance the production of the events of interest, the effects of pileup need to be mitigated to improve the sensitivity of the results.
