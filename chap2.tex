\section{The Large Hadron Collider}
The Large Hadron Collider (LHC)\cite{1748-0221-3-08-S08001} is a $26.7$ km circular collider designed to collide beams of protons at centre-of-mass energies up to 14 \TeV. Figure~\ref{fig:cern} shows the schematic representation of the accelerator complex at CERN.
