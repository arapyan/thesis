It is designed to collide proton beams with a centre-of-mass energy of 14 TeV and an unprecedented luminosity of 10 34 cm âˆ’2Â s âˆ’1 . It can also collide heavy (Pb) ions with an energy of 2.8 TeV per nucleon and a peak luminosity of 10 27 cm âˆ’2Â s âˆ’1 . In this paper, the machine design is described.}

abstract = "Over 10 000 channels from the \{CMS\} tile/fiber hadronic calorimeter (The \{CMS\} Hadron Calorimeter TDR, CERN/LHCC 97-31, June 20, 1997) will be read out by custom 19 and 73-channel HPD's in a 4 T field. Experimental constraints on the tube design have produced a faster tube with a larger active area and minimum accelerating gap. Quality assurance stations have been developed for fast processing of 600 tubes. Registration to 50 Î¼m is done in situ, providing a custom collar with alignment pins which can be mated to a universal cookie. Lifetime measurements reveal details on aging, but operation is within \{CMS\} specifications. "

This method was implemented in the DELPHI TPC off-line analysis: a flexible strategy is associated with this general principle in order to cope with specific problems (overlap and edge effects, error tails, etc.). A generalization of the method to more general configurations of tracking devices is proposed."

The algorithm starts from a small track segment or from a fitted track of a neighbouring detector, then extends the candidate tracks by adding measured points one by one. The fitted parameters and weight matrix of the candidate track are updated when adding a point, and give an increasing precision on prediction of the next point. Thus, pattern recognition and track fitting can be accomplished simultaneously. The method has been implemented and tested for track reconstruction for the vertex detector of the ZEUS experiment at DESY. Detailed procedures of the method and its performance are presented. Its flexibility is described as well."

  abstract={Vertex fitting frequently has to deal with both mis-associated tracks and mis-measured track errors. A robust, adaptive method is presented that is able to cope with contaminated data. The method is formulated as an iterative re-weighted Kalman filter. Annealing is introduced to avoid local minima in the optimization. For the initialization of the adaptive filter a robust algorithm is presented that turns out to perform well in a wide range of applications. The tuning of the annealing schedule and of the cut-off parameter is described using simulated data from the CMS experiment. Finally, the adaptive property of the method is illustrated in two examples.}

  abstract={Measurements of the jet energy calibration and transverse momentum resolution in CMS are presented, performed with a data sample collected in proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 7TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 36pb âˆ’1 . The transverse momentum balance in dijet and Î³/Z+jets events is used to measure the jet energy response in the CMS detector, as well as the transverse momentum resolution. The results are presented for three different methods to reconstruct jets: a calorimeter-based approach, the ``Jet-Plus-Track'' approach, which improves the measurement of calorimeter jets by exploiting the associated tracks, and the ``Particle Flow'' approach, which attempts to reconstruct individually each particle in the event, prior to the jet clustering, based on information from all relevant subdetectors.}

This paper describes the PandoraPFA particle flow algorithm which is then used to perform the first systematic study of the potential of high granularity \{PFlow\} calorimetry. For simulated events in the \{ILD\} detector concept, a jet energy resolution of Ïƒ E / E â‰² 3.8 % is achieved for 40â€“400 GeV jets. This result, which demonstrates that high granularity \{PFlow\} calorimetry can meet the challenging \{ILC\} jet energy resolution goals, does not depend strongly on the details of the Monte Carlo modelling of hadronic showers. The PandoraPFA algorithm is also used to investigate the general features of a collider detector optimised for high granularity \{PFlow\} calorimetry. Finally, a first study of the potential of high granularity \{PFlow\} calorimetry at a multi-TeV lepton collider, such as CLIC, is presented. "
