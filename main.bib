It is designed to collide proton beams with a centre-of-mass energy of 14 TeV and an unprecedented luminosity of 10 34 cm âˆ’2Â s âˆ’1 . It can also collide heavy (Pb) ions with an energy of 2.8 TeV per nucleon and a peak luminosity of 10 27 cm âˆ’2Â s âˆ’1 . In this paper, the machine design is described.}

abstract = "Over 10 000 channels from the \{CMS\} tile/fiber hadronic calorimeter (The \{CMS\} Hadron Calorimeter TDR, CERN/LHCC 97-31, June 20, 1997) will be read out by custom 19 and 73-channel HPD's in a 4 T field. Experimental constraints on the tube design have produced a faster tube with a larger active area and minimum accelerating gap. Quality assurance stations have been developed for fast processing of 600 tubes. Registration to 50 Î¼m is done in situ, providing a custom collar with alignment pins which can be mated to a universal cookie. Lifetime measurements reveal details on aging, but operation is within \{CMS\} specifications. "
