\chapter{Results and Interpretations}

This chapter summarizes four results using events recorded by the CMS detector at the LHC proton-proton collisions in $2011$, $2012$, and $2015$ data taking periods. The measurements of inclusive $W$ and $Z$ boson production cross sections in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}=8~\TeV$ and $\sqrt{s}=13~\TeV$ are described in section 5.1. The total and fiducial inclusive production cross sections and ratios are reported. The measured cross section values agree with NNLO QCD calculations. The leptonic branching ratio and the total width of the $W$ boson are extracted from the $W/Z$ cross section ratio measurement. The search for the SM Higgs boson decaying into a pair of tau leptons in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}=7~\TeV$ and $\sqrt{s}=8~\TeV$ is described in section 5.2. An excess of events with respect to the expected background contributions at the mass of the SM Higgs boson around $125~\GeV$ are reported. The search for heavy neutral resonances decaying into a pair of tau leptons in the context of the MSSM Higgs bosons is described in section 5.3. No excess is observed with respect to the background predictions and upper limits are set on the production cross sections times branching fractions for resonances produced in gluon fusion and b quark associated production. The results are interpreted in the context of the MSSM model with different benchmark scenarios.  
 
\section{Inclusive W and Z Production Cross Sections}

The inclusive $W$ and $Z$ boson production cross sections and their ratios have been previously measured at the LHC by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations at the LHC proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}=7~\TeV$~\cite{CMS:2011aa,Chatrchyan:2011nv,Aad:2011dm}. The corresponding measurement performed at the LHC proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}=8~\TeV$ by CMS is described in this section~\cite{Chatrchyan:2014mua}. ATLAS and CMS collaborations have also performed this measurement at the LHC proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13~\TeV$~\cite{CMS-PAS-SMP-15-004,Aad:2016naf}. The CMS preliminary measurement at the LHC collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13~\TeV$ is also described in this section. A systematic uncertainty of $4.8\%$ in total integrated luminosity was reported in~\cite{CMS-PAS-SMP-15-004}. An update to the integrated luminosity  reducing the systematic uncertainty to $2.7\%$ was reported in~\cite{CMS-PAS-LUM-15-001}. The results shown in this section include the updated integrated luminosity value and systematic uncertainty.

The electron and muon final states are used to observe the $W$ and $Z$ bosons. The $Z$ boson candidates are required to have a dilepton mass in the range of $60$ to $120~\GeV$. The $W$ and $Z$ production cross sections are also measured within the fiducial kinematic and geometric acceptance of the CMS detector.   

Section 5.1.2 describes the data samples and simulations used in the results. Section 5.1.3 describes the selection of the candidate $W$ and $Z$ events. Section 5.1.4 describes the geometrical and kinematic acceptance and associated theory uncertainties. Section 5.1.5 describes the measurements of the lepton reconstruction, selection, and trigger efficiencies. Section 5.1.6 describes the $W$ and $Z$ boson signal extraction methods. Section 5.1.7 describes the measured inclusive total and fiducial cross section measurements and ratios.
