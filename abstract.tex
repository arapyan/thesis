A search for a Standard Model Higgs boson decaying to a pair of tau leptons produced in proton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider at $\sqrt{s}=7~\TeV$ and $\sqrt{s}=8~\TeV$ centre-of-mass energies is described. Final states with at least one hadronic tau are analyzed with a data sample collected with the CMS detector corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $19.7~\ifb$ at $8~\TeV$ and $4.9~\ifb$ at $7~\TeV$. A statistically significant excess of events with respect to background prediction is observed corresponding to $3.1$ standard deviations for a Higgs mass hypothesis of $125~\GeV$. This result establishes an evidence of the $125~\GeV$ Higgs boson decay to a pair of tau leptons. Additional searches for neutral resonances decaying to a pair of tau leptons in gluon-fusion and b-quark associated production modes are performed. No significant excess is observed and exclusion limits on the production cross section times branching ratios are given for the neutral resonant mass hypotheses ranging from $90~\GeV$ to $1~\TeV$. The results are also interpreted in the context of neutral Higgs boson production in the minimal supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model. Measurements of total inclusive and fiducial W and Z boson production cross sections at $\sqrt{s}=8~\TeV$  and $\sqrt{s}=13~\TeV$ centre-of-mass energies are also described. Muon and electron final states are considered in a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $18.2~\ipb$ at $8~\TeV$ and $43~\ipb$ at $13~\TeV$. A dilepton mass in the range of $60$ to $120~\GeV$ is required for the Z boson results. The measured total inclusive cross sections times branching fractions agree with next-to-next-to-leading-order QCD cross section calculations. Ratios of cross sections with a precision of $2\%$ are also reported. Finally studies of the Standard Model Higgs boson pair production at the High-Luminosity LHC with an expected data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $3000~\ifb$ are described. Higgs boson decays resulting in bb$\gamma\gamma$ and bb$\tau\tau$ final states are considered. These are the first detailed studies of the Higgs boson pair production assuming the expected performance of the upgraded CMS detector at the High-Luminosity LHC. The expected significance for the Standard Model Higgs boson pair production signal is $1.9$ standard deviations corresponding to an expected uncertainty of $54\%$ in the signal yield.
